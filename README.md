# Overview

Assignment 1 is a project proposal and will need to be coded as an HTML page using semantic HTML5 tags. Ten or more distinct tags must be used within the body of your document when providing structure to the content of your proposal.  The one-page HTML document will implement each of the first 3 requirements.  Requirement 4 gives instructions on how you will submit and upload your work.


## Requirement 1 (Project Proposal)

Create a file named **"assignment1.html"** and code the basic html document structure.  Within the ``` <head> ```of your site, include the required meta tags (charset, keywords, description, viewport, author), the title tag which includes the topic of your site. Within the ```<body>``` of your site, include the following content listed in the bullet points below.  When providing the content below, please use the most appropriate tag to provide structure to your content.


* Draft a mission statement for your site.
* Identify three goals you hope the site will achieve. For your goals, use the ordered list and list item html tags to provide structure to your content that identifies the goals.  *Keep in mind that these are goals for the site, not goals you have for the course.  
* Identify one site you would like to model the layout of your site after and provide 3-5 sentences on why you chose the site.  The site you decide to model your site after should primarily be a model of how you would like to layout the content of your site.   
* Please provide a clickable image (the image should be a screenshot or snippet of model site) link that will allow me to navigate to the page.
Content - Estimate the number of individual Web pages your site will have (the max is 3 pages) and provide 2-3 sentence description for each page you will have for your site. Please utilize the paragraph html tag for the description of each page and a heading tag for the page name. (Your site must be less than 3 pages or 3 content areas not includeing the header or footer if you decide to do a single page application)  - Assignment 1 should only consist of 1 html document along with any supporting resources such as images.
* Target audience - Describe the typical audience for the site.  What are some characteristics of the end-users. Explain who would come to your site any what they would seek once they arrive at your site.
* Presentation requirements - Your proposal must be presented within a fixed-layout.  The content of you document should be centered within the web page and margins must be zeroed out within the browser.


## Requirement 2 (Implementing Hierarchical File Structure):

Your project folder should implement a hierarchical file structure that includes an images and CSS directory along with the the HTML document that contains your requirements.  Your project folder should comply to ISO 9660 standards and implement correct relative file path for the images contained within your website.

## Requirement 3 (Validation and Good Coding Practices and Standards):  
Each page of your site must be sent through W3C Markup Validation service. All errors and warnings must be rectified before submission.  

The links to W3C is below:

* https://validator.w3.org/ (Links to an external site.)

Implement good coding practices by commenting your name and date at the top of the document and implementing indentation to display parent-child relationships.

## Requirement 4 (Submission and Publishing your project):
Once you are finished meeting all requirements, you will need to be submit your work to the assigned GitHub repository provided to you by the instructor.  In Sakai, you will need to submit the link to your repository by the due date and time listed in the write-up. Make sure you receive confirmation from Sakai that your assignment has been submitted.
