# Overview

Assignment 1 is a project proposal and will need to be coded as an HTML page using semantic HTML5 tags. Ten or more distinct tags must be used within the body of your document when providing structure to the content of your proposal.  The one-page HTML document will implement each of the first 3 requirements.  Requirement 4 gives instructions on how you will submit and upload your work.


## Requirement 1 (Project Proposal)

Create a file named **"assignment1.html"** and code the basic html document structure.  Within the <head> of your site, include the required meta tags (charset, keywords, description, viewport, author), the title tag which includes the topic of your site. Within the <body> of your site, include the following content listed in the bullet points below.  When providing the content below, please use the most appropriate tag to provide structure to your content.


* Draft a mission statement for your site.
* Identify three goals you hope the site will achieve. [Use the ordered list and list item html tags to structure your goals]
* Identify one site you would like to model the layout of your site after and provide 3-5 sentences on why you chose the site.  The site you decide to model your site after should primarily be a model of how you would like to layout the content of your site.   
* Please provide a clickable image (the image should be a screenshot or snippet of model site) link that will allow me to navigate to the page.
Content - Estimate the number of individual Web pages your site will have and provide 2-3 sentence description for each page you will have for your site. Please utilize the paragraph html tag for the description of each page and a heading tag for the page name. (Your site must be more than 5 pages or 5 content areas if you decide to do a single page application)  - Assignment 1 does not have to be five html pages, but your final project submission in week 12 must include 5 or more html pages/content areas)
* Target audience - Describe the typical audience for the site.  What are some characteristics of the end-users. Explain who would come to your site any what they would seek once they arrive at your site.
* Presentation requirements - Your proposal must be presented within a fixed-layout.  The content of you document should be centered within the web page and margins must be zeroed out within the browser.


## Requirement 2 (Implementing Hierarchical File Structure):

Your project folder should implement a hierarchical file structure that includes an images and CSS directory along with the the HTML document that contains your requirements.  Your project folder should comply to ISO 9660 standards and implement correct relative file path for the images contained within your website.

## Requirement 3 (Validation and Good Coding Practices and Standards):  
Each page of your site must be sent through W3C Markup Validation service. All errors and warnings must be rectified before submission.
